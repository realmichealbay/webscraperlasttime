# this project was made because my teacher assigned 700 terms from a glossary to do,
# luckily the lazy ass developer i am decided to try web scraping for the first time
# so this web scraper, scrapes pltw.org on its glossary getting each term and definition
# it then console.log's the terms and definitions in a format like this Term,Definition;
# coincidentally this is the exact way you can import terms and definitions on quizlet
